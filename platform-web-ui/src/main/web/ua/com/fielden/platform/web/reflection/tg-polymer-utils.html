     * Removes all Light DOM children from Polymer 'element'.
     *
     * The need for such utility method arose from the fact that Polymer (currently 1.4 version) returns 
     * from Polymer.dom(element).childNodes, Polymer.dom(element).firstChild, Polymer.dom(element).firstElementChild methods
     * not only Light DOM children, but also Local DOM children, including the elements in the template and whitespace 
     * nodes in the template.
     *
     * Please, note that Polymer.dom().flush() call is needed to be done manually after this method has been used. 
     * The intention was made for the cases, where some additional DOM manipulation is needed, and in such cases
     * flush() call could be efficiently done after all DOM manipulation once.
