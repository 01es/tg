This document describes GIS web component use cases and features. The new version of GIS web component resembles close approximation to web-browser compatible GIS view for desktop and mobile browsers. Also it has been incorporated into existing Trident Genesis desktop client through the use of JavaFX embedded browser technology.

The main purpose of the document is to describe the capabilities of the developed GIS support and the potential that can be achieved with selected methodology. All graphic nodes and primitives such as tracks, geo-zones and geographical points have been developed purely with browser technologies. It gives an ability to use it in web browsers (desktop as well as mobile browsers). The efficiency and customisability has been investigated during development. Real life examples have been constructed to demostrate interesting use cases in GPS-tracking software.
