\section{Introduction}\label{sec:01}
  Software information systems\footnote{In this article the term \emph{information system} is used interchangably with term \emph{software application}.} (IS) are ubiquitous in the modern society, which makes the ability to create and maintain reliable software critical from both consumer and manufacturer perspectives.
  The ideas and facilities built into a software application fully determine its purpose and value to the consumper (end user).
  That's why the subject of this article are the technological innovations, which combined define a unique technology for the development of reliable business oriented information systems -- the Trident Genesis Platform (TG).

  First of all, it is important to understand what motivated the creation of TG and thus determined its main purpose.
  The evolution of computers lead to increase of computational power, which facilitated a significant incease of the amount of data that can be processed, and at the same time lead to a need for higher level of abstractions when creating software applications.
  Programming languages are at the core of software development, which also evolved -- from machine languages and assembly to modern mainstream programming languages such as Java, Scala, C\# etc.
  However, due to their nature all programming langages are convenient for instructing the computing machines how to perform specific computations, but not convetient for decribing the actual problem domain of the business being automated\footnote{Business for which an information system is being created.}.
  
   
  Tap into the power of modern IDEs and existing programming skills of software developers.
