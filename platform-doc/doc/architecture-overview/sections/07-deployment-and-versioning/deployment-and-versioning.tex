\section{Other Essentials \ldots}\label{sec:07}

  The platform provides other essential functionality that cannot be described in details as part of this document.
  In this section, we would like only to highlight some of it.

\paragraph{Application Security.}

  The platform incorporates both authentication and authorisation mechanisms that govern application security.
  The authentication mechanism is heavily influenced by Amazon S3 token-based security schema in combination with RSA encryption.
  It works automatically out of the box and may require developers only to plug-in the server-side user identification model.
  The default model implementation, provided as part of the platform, stores all user credentials in the back-end database.
  Alternative application specific implementations may work with LDAP server or any other organisation specific mechanism.
  
  Unlike authentication, the authorisation mechanism is used more explicitly during application development, which is required to support fine-grained access control.
  The platform provides a unique declarative authorisation mechanism that ergonomically fits into the development model using the object-oriented paradigm.
  A concept of \emph{security token} represents a security demarcation mechanism, which can be applied to the smallest execution artefact such as accessors to domain entity properties or any other method in the domain model.
  As opposite to many other existing technologies where the authorisation mechanism is often associated with UI controls, the platform unifies the authorisation mechanism with the business domain model.
  This way, no matter where in the application logic (including UI and other client- or server-side modules) a certain business functionality is accessed it is always protected.
  
  Security tokens are type safe and may form hierarchies by reusing the object-oriented mechanism of inheritance.
  This provides a convenient way to logically group security tokens.
  Another important concept is the \emph{security demarcation scope}.
  It provides an automatic conflict resolution for nested scopes of the application logic demarcated by security tokens with different permissions.
 
  The concept of semantic transparency is also applied to the authorisation mechanism.
  Application developers and administrators, who control user permissions, perceive security tokens in exactly the same semantic context.
  For example, this facilitates cooperation of these stakeholders to devise the most appropriate structure and scope for security tokens.

  All application users are based on the provided by the platform user-model.
  Each TG-based application maintains identity of the currently logged in user, which covers both client- and server-sides\footnote{
    In order to support stateless server-side implementation, the platform does not maintain any user sessions at the server. 
    In order to identify requests from different users, an individual security token, associated with each logged in user, is transmitted with every HTTP request.}.
  This way application business logic may easily access any specific to the currently logged in user information in order to gain even greater control over the  execution flow.
  
  In order to streamline application administration and reuse of different configurations (e.g. report configurations), the platform introduces the concept of the \emph{base-user} and \emph{based-on-user}.
  The platform is very consistent in following its object-orientation and this new concept is not an exception.
  There can be several base-users that are used for providing different application configurations.
  The rest of application users are derived from any of the available base-users -- these are the based-on-users.
  This leads to application configuration inheritance where based-on-users fully inherit predefined for their respective base-user configuration.
  Any changes to configurations by base-users lead to the automatic pushing of these changes to all corresponding based-on-users.
  At the same time, there is still a great degree of freedom in controlling individual based-on-users.
  For example, application roles assignment and security token permissions are individual for all users.
  
  The platform also provides a model for automatic user-based data filtering to control user access to domain entities individually.
  Developers only need to implement the filtering rules (e.g. specify the filtering criteria) and the platform fully automates their execution.
  For example, any EQL query, either manually implemented by developers as part of some business logic or automatically composed by means of UI configuration tools, gets automatically transformed to incorporate filtering conditions.
