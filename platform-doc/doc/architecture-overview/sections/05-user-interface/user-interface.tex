\section{Domain-Driven UI Model}\label{sec:05}

  User interface (UI) serves an important role for business applications.
  There are two reason for this:
  \begin{itemize}
   \item For a large number of enterprise employees, a business application represents the main application used during the day. 
	 These people work with the business application for a good portion of their working day, but at the same time they aren't necessarily the savvy computer users.
   \item Usually, UI of business applications is of considerable size having multiple forms, tabsheets, menus etc.
  \end{itemize}
  Unlike other types of software systems, business applications contain hundreds of forms, which may change over time as the result of application evolution and changes to business rules.
  This results in a considerable effort to develop and support UI of business applications.
  Acknowledging the above, Trident Genesis incorporates a full support for domain-driven UI implementation into the provided development model.
  It provides a number of mechanisms for rapid development of uniform user interfaces, which includes windowing model, a system of forms, type-oriented UI controls, implicit multi-threading model etc.
  
  The principle idea implemented in TG for building UI, is the full reuse of metadata, type information and business logic controllers in order to support a nearly automatic UI construction with little involvement of the developer.
