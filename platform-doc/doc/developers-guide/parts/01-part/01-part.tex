\part{Domain Driven Design with TG}  
  This part covers in depth the provided by the platform development model, methodology, core components, information flow and API.
  We've tried to stay on point linking together the developed modelling mechanisms with practical examples.
  

  All examples in this part build on the project generated and modified in part~\ref{part-I} of the book.
  Therefore, in case it was skipped it makes sense to go back, generated the training project and perform its modifications as described in chapter~\ref{ch00:03}.
