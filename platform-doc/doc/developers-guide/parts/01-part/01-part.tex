\part{Core API}  
  This part covers in depth the core platform components, information flow and API.
  The first chapter is a quick start to get the reader up and running with a fully fledged TG-based application in no time by using the Maven artifact distributed as part of the platform.
  Further chapters methodically address each aspect of the platform and its role in application development.
