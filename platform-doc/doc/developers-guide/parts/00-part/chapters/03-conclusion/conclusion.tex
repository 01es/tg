\chapter{Conclusion}

  This chapter showed how to start developing TG-based applications using the provided Maven archetype and Eclipse IDE.
  The examples should give a good feel as to what it's like to develop applications based on the platform -- the domain model is at the heart of the application with everything else such as UI revolving around it.
  Such approach significantly streamlines both the development process as well as simplifies software maintenance.

  The application setup demonstrated in this chapter is used in the rest of the book to guide the reader through platform features and capabilities.
